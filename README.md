# Computational-Science

This is a traffic model to simulate the traffic flow on Dutch highways.

When you start the simulation, please let your computer run the trials.
Don't make use of the mouse or anything else as this affects the simulation and will make the results non-reproducable.
The current settings that create the graph below let the model run for little over *30 minutes*. We know. We recommend making yourself some food or start a new hobby. 


## How to use
have pygame installed

In line ... set if you want to run the simulation in a rush hour situation or not

If you have generated the graphs below, you can make some adjustments to run your own simulation
change duration of simulation, t and length


There are 3 ways to end the simulation:
1. Let the full simulation run
2. Close the pygame window 
3. Press the escape key

Only by finishing the full simulation graphs will be generated
