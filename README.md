This is a traffic model to simulate the traffic flow on Dutch highways.

When you start the simulation, please let your computer run the trials.
One simulation will take a little over 30 minutes. For both graphs it will take a little over an hour. During this time we ask you to leave your computer alone, as the mouse and other internal proccesses affect the results. Which will make it not reproducable.


## How to use
Have the requirments installed as mentioned in requirments.txt
Run traffic_sim.py

If you have generated the graphs you can compare it to the graphs folder, you can make some adjustments to run your own simulation
change duration of simulation, t and length


There are 3 ways to end the simulation:
1. Let the full simulation run
2. Close the pygame window 
3. Press the escape key

Only by finishing the full simulation graphs will be generated
